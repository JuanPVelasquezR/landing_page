# landing_page

Simple static landing page built as part of The Odin Project "Foundations" exercise. Theme: Lovecraftian / cosmic horror.

## Project structure
- [`index.html`](index.html) — Main page.
- [`styles.css`](styles.css) — Styles for the page.
- [`images/`](images/) — Images used by the site.
- [`README.md`](README.md) — This file.

## Usage
1. Open [`index.html`](index.html) in a browser (double-click or drag into the browser).
2. No build step or server required — pure HTML + CSS.

## Quick customization
- Edit text and structure in [`index.html`](index.html).
- Adjust colors, spacing, and typography in [`styles.css`](styles.css).
- Replace or update assets in the [`images/`](images/) folder; update paths in [`index.html`](index.html) if names change.

## Notes
- Verify image licenses before publishing (many images appear to be sourced from external sites).
- The layout is a simple exercise; accessibility and responsiveness can be improved for production use.
